To connoisseurs of feminist absurdity, the Oxford Dictionary's definition of sexism is a gem. Any oversimplified claim that something is "typical" is a stereotype. So if sexism is stereotyping men and women, then claiming that sexism is "typically against women" is sexist.

The Oxford Dictionary's definition of sexism is---by its own definition---sexist.

It's not alone. Look at how three major dictionaries define and illustrate sexism:

**Cambridge Dictionary:**

> sexism (noun) (actions based on) the belief that the members of one sex are less intelligent, able, skilful, etc. than the members of the other sex, **especially that women are less able than men**: The university has been accused of sexism because it has so few **women** professors.

**American heritage dictionary of the English language:**

> sex·ism n.(1) Discrimination based on gender, **especially discrimination against women**. (2) The belief that one gender is superior to the other, **especially that men are superior to women**.

**Merriam-Webster:**

> sexism noun sex·ism \ˈsek-ˌsi-zəm\ : (1) prejudice or discrimination based on sex; especially : **discrimination against women** (2) behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex

And, in even in their definition of _stereotype_, the Oxford Dictionary's illustration is sexist:

{{<epigraph src="The Oxford Dictionary">}}
a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing: the stereotype of the <strong>woman as the carer</strong>
{{< /epigraph >}}


This isn't coincidental: feminists deploy a wide range of strategies to manufacture and sustain the illusion that women are the disproportionate victims of sexism. For example: feminist ideologue Laura Bates peddles a website that collects women's anecdotes of trivial offences and slights:

{{<epigraph src="Laura Bates, 'The Everyday Sexism Project'">}}
If you have experienced sexism, just everyday, small, so-used-to-it-you-almost-just-accept-it sexism, please share your story
{{< /epigraph >}}

Reports of any sexism towards men are excluded, and reports of trivial sexism perceived by women are aggregated to manufacture the illusion of meaningful sexism towards women. The result, in a society in which 90% of the homeless are men, and 90% of the homeless shelters are reserved for women, is a tawdry confection of unwanted compliments and unacceptable supermarket clothing selections. _"It seems to be increasingly difficult to talk about sexism, equality and women’s rights in a modern society that perceives itself to have achieved gender equality"_, complains Bates. Well, quite.

In fact, sexism towards men in our society is harmful and widespread, spanning a broad range of legal, social, and economic issues; from infanthood through school, college, work, and retirement; in healthcare, life expectancy, occupational injury and disease, divorce, family law, and criminal law; and as victims of suicide, violent crime, and state violence. Yet our culture defines sexism as a phenomenon that "typically" women experience.

That most people accept the Oxford Dictionary's casual feminist sexism without thought is another clue that we are immersed in a gynocentric society that fixates exclusively on the trivial grievances of women. Or, as Bates would say, _"so-used-to-it-you-almost-just-accept-it sexism."_

Anyway, let's fix that Oxford dictionary definition:
