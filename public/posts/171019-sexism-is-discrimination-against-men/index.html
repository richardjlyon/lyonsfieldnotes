    <p>To connoisseurs of feminist absurdity, the Oxford Dictionary&rsquo;s definition of sexism is a gem. Any oversimplified claim that something is &ldquo;typical&rdquo; is a stereotype. So if sexism is stereotyping men and women, then claiming that sexism is &ldquo;typically against women&rdquo; is sexist.</p>

<p>The Oxford Dictionary&rsquo;s definition of sexism is&mdash;by its own definition&mdash;sexist.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not alone. Look at how three major dictionaries define and illustrate sexism:</p>

<p><strong>Cambridge Dictionary:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>sexism (noun) (actions based on) the belief that the members of one sex are less intelligent, able, skilful, etc. than the members of the other sex, <strong>especially that women are less able than men</strong>: The university has been accused of sexism because it has so few <strong>women</strong> professors.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>American heritage dictionary of the English language:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>sex·ism n.(1) Discrimination based on gender, <strong>especially discrimination against women</strong>. (2) The belief that one gender is superior to the other, <strong>especially that men are superior to women</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Merriam-Webster:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
<p>sexism noun sex·ism \ˈsek-ˌsi-zəm\ : (1) prejudice or discrimination based on sex; especially : <strong>discrimination against women</strong> (2) behavior, conditions, or attitudes that foster stereotypes of social roles based on sex</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And, in even in their definition of <em>stereotype</em>, the Oxford Dictionary&rsquo;s illustration is stereotypical:</p>

<figure class="epigraph">
  <blockquote>
    
a widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing: the stereotype of the <strong>woman as the carer</strong>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t coincidental: feminists deploy a wide range of strategies to manufacture and sustain the illusion that women are the disproportionate victims of sexism. For example: feminist ideologue Laura Bates peddles a website that collects women&rsquo;s anecdotes of trivial offences and slights:</p>

<figure class="epigraph">
  <blockquote>
    
If you have experienced sexism, just everyday, small, so-used-to-it-you-almost-just-accept-it sexism, please share your story

    
    <footer class="uk-text-right uk-text-muted">
      <cite>&#8212; Laura Bates, &#39;The Everyday Sexism Project&#39;</cite>
    </footer>
    
  </blockquote>
</figure>


<p>Reports of any sexism towards men are excluded, and reports of trivial sexism perceived by women are aggregated to manufacture the illusion of meaningful sexism towards women. The result, in a society in which 90% of the homeless are men, and 90% of the homeless shelters are reserved for women, is a tawdry confection of unwanted compliments and unacceptable supermarket clothing selections. <em>&ldquo;It seems to be increasingly difficult to talk about sexism, equality and women’s rights in a modern society that perceives itself to have achieved gender equality&rdquo;</em>, complains Bates. Well, quite.</p>

<p>In fact, sexism towards men in our society is harmful and widespread, spanning a broad range of legal, social, and economic issues; from infanthood through school, college, work, and retirement; in healthcare, life expectancy, occupational injury and disease, divorce, family law, and criminal law; and as victims of suicide, violent crime, and state violence. Yet our culture defines sexism as a phenomenon that &ldquo;typically&rdquo; women experience.</p>

<p>That most people accept the Oxford Dictionary&rsquo;s casual feminist sexism without thought is another clue that we are immersed in a gynocentric society that fixates exclusively on the trivial grievances of women. Or, as Bates would say, <em>&ldquo;so-used-to-it-you-almost-just-accept-it sexism.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Anyway, let&rsquo;s fix that Oxford dictionary definition:</p>
